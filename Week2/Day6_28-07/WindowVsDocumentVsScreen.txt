Q.Diffrence between Window,Screen and Document?
Soln.
1.Window Object
  It sits at the top of the hierarchy and represents the browser window.The window object is supported by all browsers. All global JavaScript objects ,
  functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser . This window object
  has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.It basically represents the current
  browsing context. Moreover, the window property of a window object points to the window object itself. So the following ststements all return the same window
  object: 
	window.window	
	window.window.window
	window.window.window.window
	...

2.Document
  Document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.Document doesn’t refer to the <html> element, rather,
  it is like an outer wrapper that contains <html> The <html> tag can be accessed via document.documentElement.It represents any web page loaded in browser and 
  serves as an entry point into web page`s content,i.e. DOM tree. When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. It is the
  root node of the HTML document. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
  HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument
  interface.

3.Screen
  Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions . It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc. It is not
  mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. It can be written without window prefix.
       -Properties: 
	screen.width
	screen.height
	screen.availWidth
	screen.availHeight
