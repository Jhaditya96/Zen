Q.Diffrence Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2?

Soln.

Following are features executed by both and advantages over another:

1.Request multiplexing

  Http/1.1 uses diffrent TCP connections for sending diffrent requsted files one in a connection.

  While Http/2 can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection which allows you to download web 
  files asynchronosly from one server.

  This results in significant lower server load.And additional round trip time(RTT),making your website load faster without
  any optimization,and makes domain sharding unnecessary.

2.Header compression

  HTTP/2 compress a large number of redundant header frames. It uses the HPACK specification as a simple and secure approach
  to header compression. Both client and server maintain a list of headers used in previous client-server requests.

  HPACK compresses the individual value of each header before it is transferred to the server, which then looks up the 
  encoded information in a list of previously transferred header values to reconstruct the full header information.

This feature was not present in HTTP/1.1 and so this header was not compressed in that resulting in resending of header 
values again and again making it recursive in same operation and inefficient.

3.Binary Protocol

  HTTP/1.1 used to process text commands to complete request-response cycles.

  HTTP/2 will use binary commands to execute same tasks and eases complications with framing and also simplifies confusing
  intermixed text and optional command spaces.Its implementation will convert the same text commands into binary before
  transmitting it over the network.

4.Server Push

  HTTP/2 server push might be the best feature over HTTP/1.1 which allows the server to send additional cacheable information
  to the client that isn`t requested but is anticipated in future requests.

--Benefits:
-The client saves pushed resources in the cache.
-The client can reuse these cached resources across different pages.
-The server can multiplex pushed resources along with originally requested information within the same TCP connection.
-The server can prioritize pushed resources — a key performance differentiator in HTTP/2 vs HTTP1.
-The client can decline pushed resources to maintain an effective repository of cached resources or disable Server Push 
 entirely.
-The client can also limit the number of pushed streams multiplexed concurrently.

Conclusion:
 =>OverAll Benefits of HTTP/2 over HTTP/1.1
  -Low overhead in parsing data — a critical value proposition in HTTP/2 vs HTTP1.
  -Less prone to errors.
  -Lighter network footprint.
  -Effective network resource utilization.
  -Eliminating security concerns associated with the textual nature of HTTP1.x such as response splitting attacks.
  -Enables other capabilities of the HTTP/2 including compression, multiplexing, prioritization, flow control and effective handling of TLS.
  -Compact representation of commands for easier processing and implementation.
  -Efficient and robust in terms of processing of data between client and server.
  -Reduced network latency and improved throughput.
