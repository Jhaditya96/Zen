Q.Is it necessary to write HEAD,Body and HTML tags?
Soln.Yes,It is very necessary.The tags sometimes decide in large part on the ranking that controls your website behind the
scenes.Technically speaking, meta tags are HTML tags, they appear in specific places located within the header 
tags (for example, <head> </head>).These tags often are convinient to use while prototyping and especially when 
writing test cases as it helps keep the mark-up focused on the test in question. The inference process should create the 
elements in exactly the manner that you see in Firebug, and browsers are pretty consistent in doing that.
The main reasons why tagging your website is important are:
1. Extremely important for Search Engines Results.
2. Your page rankings are effected by the Meta Tags.
3. Helps your visitors and web crawlers understand the contents of each web page.
4. Makes your code more systematic and easier to understand with sensible tags and operation intented to put there.

Hint: It is not wise to fill the keyword tags with words that aren’t part of your web page. Actually, the major search 
engines (Google, for example) aren’t using this tag anymore. However, the smaller search engines continue to use this tag 
in their search engine rankings; in other words, the keyword tag can determine where your website is placed in comparison 
to your competitors for a particular keyword or keyword phrase.

e.g.<Title> Your Website Title </Title>
