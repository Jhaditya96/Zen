Q.Write a blog about Objects and its internal representation in JavaScript
Soln.Objects,in JS, is its most important data-type.An object is a reference data type which are assigned with a reference
     value given a pointer to its values.This pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.
Basically,It`s an unordered collection of related data,of primitve or reference types,in the form of "key:value: pairs.
These Objects are created with {...} with an optional list of properties.A property is "key:value" pair,where a key is a 
string(also called a "property name"), and value can be anything.
E.G.
let college = {
name : “Sardar Patel Institute Of Technology”,
location : “Mumbai”,
established : “1950s”
}

1.Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object. An object in JavaScript may also have a function as a 
  member, in which case it will be known as a method of that object.
  Like:
let college = {
name : "Sardar Patel Institute Of Technology",
location : "Mumbai",
established : "1950s"
displayInfo : function(){
console.log(  ${college.name}
              was established in
 	      ${college.established}
	      at
	      ${college.location}
	   );
}}
college.displayInfo();

2.The property names can be strings or numbers. In case the property names are numbers, they must be accessed using the 
"bracket notation" like this :
let college = {
name : "Sardar Patel Institute Of Technology",
location : "Mumbai",
established : "1950s"
20 : 1000,
college.displayInfo();
displayInfo : function(){
console.log(The value of the key 20 is ${college['20']});
}
}
college.displayInfo();

3.Object Constructor : Another way to create objects in JavaScript involves using the “Object” constructor. The Object 
constructor creates an object wrapper for the given value. This, used in conjunction with the “new” keyword allows us to 
initialize new objects.
E.g. :
const school = new Object();
college.name = 'Sardar Patel';
college.locn = 'Mumbai';
college.est = 1950;

college.displayInfo = function(){
console.log(${college.name} was established
in ${college.established} at ${college.location});
}

college.displayInfo();

Also,
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
this.name = name;
this.maker = maker;
}

let car1 = new Vehicle('Fiesta', ‘Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle('Santa Fe', 'Hyundai')

console.log(car1.name); 
console.log(car2.name);

4.Object.fromEntries() — In this method transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object.
E.g.
const entries = new Map([
['foo', 'bar'],
['bach', 42]
]);
const obj = Object.fromEntries(entries);
console.log(obj);
// expected output: Object { foo: “bar”, bach: 42 }
