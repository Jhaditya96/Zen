Q.Auth & CORS?
Soln.
=>Authorization header

-The Authroization HTTP header is provided with authentication info on respective request.When someone gives wrong response
it will reject its authentication with 401 response with a WWW=Authenticate header.This triggers the browser to ask for 
user credentials.The browser also performs the same request,but include an Authorization header with entered credentials.

=>CORS

-The Cross Origin Resourse Sharing is a security mechanism that allows a web page to access one domain with diffrent domain
 It provides relaxation of the same-origin policy implemented in browsers.

-CORS sends an Authorization header along with a request to another site which has to notify the browser of its permission.
 After all,not all sites are authorized to provide access e.g. like bank sites.However,there are some cases for cross-site
 access.In that case,the CORS HTTP response header can grant access to the other domain and so the application that handles 
 the request has to give its permission to be used.This permission can be given by server with credentials  by either the
 browser or from your Authentication with Authorization header.
 E.g.When Browser support HTTP basic authentication with username and password and sends it with every sebsequent request.
     OR when this Authorization header is sent with a request from JavaScript by just specifying the name and value of the 
     header.It works just like basic authentication only.
